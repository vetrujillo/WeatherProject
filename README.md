# WeatherProject
Let's get to work

To begin: I used the following tutorial to build a foundation for my program, though I tweaked it a bit to better fit my needs

Quick Rundown: After completing the initial build on the master branch, I added CLI functionality with argparse to allow for easier specification of destination email addresses. 

Dependencies: [Requirements](./Requirements.txt)

Todo: Design a test for project; add location specification to CLI functionality; expand email capabilities to allow for multiple recipients; design simple GUI for increased ease of use
