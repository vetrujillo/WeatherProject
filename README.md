# WeatherProject
Let's get to work

To begin: I used the following tutorial to build a foundation for my program, though I tweaked it a bit to better fit my needs

Quick Rundown: This project was undertaken to solidify some basic Python skills. It is a simple data scraping script, designed to parse HTML data from a weather site and pull weather information for a specified location. The program then emails that data, in plaintext, to a specified email. After completing the initial build, I added CLI functionality with argparse to allow for easier specification of destination email addresses. 

Dependencies: Requirements.txt

Todo: Design a test for project; add location specification to CLI functionality; expand email capabilities to allow for multiple recipients; design simple GUI for increased ease of use
